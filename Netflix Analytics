In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data. 

What attribute is the same on both tables?
SELECT NP.director, NTI.type, NTI.duration, NTI.country, NTI.rating FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS NP 
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS NTI 
ON NP.show_id=NTI.show_id;

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 
SELECT Count(*) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" WHERE type='Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
SELECT type, date_added, release_year FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" WHERE date_added>='2021' ORDER BY release_year;
SELECT max(date(date_added)) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
SELECT title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" ORDER BY title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT NP.director, NTI.title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS NP 
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS NTI 
ON NP.show_id=NTI.show_id WHERE NTI.title='Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
SELECT title, release_year FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" WHERE type='Movie' ORDER BY release_year asc Limit 2;
SELECT title, release_year FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" WHERE type = 'Movie'AND release_year <= (SELECT MIN(release_year) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
